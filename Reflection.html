          <h4 class="content2">The focus topic of this assignment is the development of technology and its future outcome. It is important to plan as one of the main key process to developing design, project or technology. As it could cause disastrous consequences or impact. It is especially paramount to consider all possible outcomes and plan to prevent unwanted results.

            To further the discussion on developing technology, prototyping is an important factor for a successful project. This can be beta testing samples distributed to individuals to find out their feedback, opinion and criticism to further develop the technology or project from the user’s experience. Prototyping can also be in the very beginning of the designing phase whereby sticky notes with interface drawn onto them and stuck onto a board. This very simple process will help discover the best aesthetic, efficient or user-friendly design. Prototyping should always be apart of developing a project and planned for every design.<br><br>
The common goal for the development of technology is to aide human needs. But with caution, for example artificial intelligence it could be help find a cure for untreatable diseases or it could spell the end of humanity and take over the world as depicted in movies. The topic of artificial intelligence is sensitive as it is very sensitive. Whereby we do not know what would happen when artificial intelligence develop to the point where is it on par or surpass human intelligence and either continue to be controlled by us or become uncontrollable to the point where it might see us humans redundant. Which is a pessimistic view of the future development of artificial intelligence and maybe the result of “The fear of the unknown… usually, an individual chooses to run away from the situation, and in the process losses certain opportunities in life”<sup>1</sup>. In this case the opportunity lost could possibly be finding the cure for cancer.
