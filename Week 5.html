          <h4 class="content">Select one positive and one negative review of AI technologies and provide a summary of each argument and an overview of your personal view about the future of our interactions with AI machines. </h4>

          <h4 class="content2">There are many assumptions of positive and negative effects of developing artificial intelligence comparable to humans. Many are also sceptical of such advanced technology it being “impossible” or worried that such technology is just right around the corner and that it would replace us humans.<br><br>The main argument and negative view of artificial intelligent which Professor Stephen Hawking also assume and said that, “It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever increasing rate”.<sup>1</sup> What Professor Stephen Hawking fears is that with the development of artificial intelligent which can compare or surpass human intelligent that it would further develop on its own and the consequences are unpredictable. The main reason Professor Stephen Hawking fears that artificial intelligence will cause negative effects to humans is that “Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn't compete, and would be superseded”<sup>2</sup> and therefore possibly replace humans.<br><br></h4>

       		  There are also people such as Rollo Carpenter the creator of the popular artificial intelligent which you can chat with, “Cleverbot”<sup>3</sup> who is pessimistic about artificial intelligent and believes “we will remain in charge of the technology for a decently long time and the potential of it to solve many of the world problems will be realised”.<sup>4</sup> What Rollo Carpenter is assuming is that artificial intelligence is a long ways away from surpassing human intelligence and that we can utilise it at its current state and aide our lives.<br><br>

       		  I believe the development of artificial intelligence will lead to positive impacts and that it will help us develop technology, solve theories and research the cure for diseases. I assume that our interaction with artificial intelligence will help improve our daily lives like the Sci-Fi movies.
